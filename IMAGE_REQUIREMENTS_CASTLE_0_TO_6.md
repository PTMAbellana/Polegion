## **IMAGE STYLE GUIDELINES**

### General Requirements:
- **File Format:** PNG with transparency where appropriate
- **Resolution:** Minimum 1024x1024 for concept images, 2048x2048 for backgrounds
- **Color Scheme:** 
  - Castle 1: Blue/cyan tones (foundational geometry)
  - Castle 2: Purple/indigo (angles and measurement)
  - Castle 3: Teal/aqua (circles and curves)
  - Castle 4: Orange/amber (polygons)
  - Castle 5: Deep purple/cosmic (3D geometry)
  - Castle 6: Gold/yellow (championship)

### Educational Image Requirements:
1. **Clarity:** All diagrams must have clear labels and measurements
2. **Consistency:** Use same labeling style across all images (e.g., always use capital letters for points)
3. **Measurement Notation:**
   - Degrees: 45°, 90°, 180°
   - Length: Use units (cm, m) consistently
   - Angles: Use arc notation with degree symbol
4. **Color Coding:**
   - Right angles: Small square symbol
   - Equal sides: Same color or tick marks
   - Equal angles: Same arc notation
   - Parallel lines: Arrow notation

### Character/Wizard Design:
- Fantasy/magical aesthetic
- Friendly, approachable appearance for educational context
- Each wizard should have unique color scheme matching their castle
- Hold or be surrounded by relevant geometric tools/symbols

### 3D Shape Rendering:
- Use perspective and shading to show depth
- Make faces distinguishable (different shades/colors)
- Include dimension labels (length, width, height, radius)
- Show dashed lines for hidden edges

## **TOTAL IMAGE COUNT: 155+ images**

### Breakdown by Castle:
- **Castle 0:** 0 lesson images (assessment only)
- **Castle 1:** 29 images (basic geometry foundations)
- **Castle 2:** 25 images (angles and measurements)
- **Castle 3:** 12 images (circles)
- **Castle 4:** 26 images (polygons advanced)
- **Castle 5:** 42 images (3D geometry)
- **Castle 6:** 0 lesson images (final assessment)
- **Universal:** 21 images (wizards, backgrounds, UI)

---

## **PRIORITY LEVELS FOR IMAGE CREATION:**

### HIGH PRIORITY (Core Learning Images):
1. All basic shape definitions (Castle 1: point, line, ray, segment, polygons)
2. Angle types (Castle 2: acute, right, obtuse, straight, reflex)
3. Circle parts (Castle 3: center, radius, diameter, chord, arc, sector)
4. 3D shape diagrams with formulas (Castle 5: all volume & surface area images)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
1. Wizard character images (7 wizards total)
2. Relic artifacts (17 total)
3. Detailed polygon diagrams (Castle 1 & 4)
4. Angle relationship diagrams (Castle 2)

### LOW PRIORITY:
1. Background environment images
2. UI elements and icons
3. Decorative/aesthetic images
4. Alternative examples and supplementary diagrams

## **NOTES:**
- All audio narration files are already listed in chapter constants (separate from images)
- Minigames may generate shapes dynamically, but reference images help ensure consistency
- Some images may be reused across chapters with different contexts
- Consider creating SVG versions for scalable/interactive diagrams
