## Conclusion

The pretest results reveal **significant knowledge gaps** across all categories, with no students achieving a passing grade. The class average of 35% indicates that students are entering the course with **limited foundational knowledge** in geometry and mathematical reasoning.

**Priority areas for immediate intervention:**
1. Analytical Thinking (31.0%)
2. Problem-Solving (33.8%)
3. Procedural Skills (33.8%)

**Positive indicators:**
- Knowledge Recall shows students can memorize facts (40.6%)
- Top performers reached 50-53%, showing it's achievable
- Most students completed the test (no dropouts)

**Recommendation:** Implement a **2-week foundation course** before main curriculum to address these gaps, with particular focus on analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
