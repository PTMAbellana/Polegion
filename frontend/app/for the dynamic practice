Great idea! Adding dynamic practice multiple-choice questions for each of the 6 categories is one of the BEST ways to improve mastery, retrieval practice, and student engagement.

Below is a complete framework for generating dynamic questions, plus example templates, formulas, and how to programmatically create randomized MCQs with correct and incorrect options.

✅ 1. How Dynamic Question Generation Works

For each category:

You create a question template
e.g., "Find the area of a square with side length ___."

The system inserts random values
e.g., side = 3, 6, 10, etc.

The system computes:

Correct Answer

Plausible distractors (incorrect options)

You store the question, options, and correct choice in the database.

🟦 2. Category-by-Category Dynamic MCQ Templates

Below are ready-to-use examples for your system.

🎯 CATEGORY 1 — Knowledge Recall

Simple definition/fact-based questions.

Template Example

Q: “A triangle has how many sides?”
Options:

3 (correct)

4

5

6

Dynamic Template

Q: “A polygon with ___ sides is called what?”
Random side numbers = 3,4,5,6,8,10
Correct answer = name
Distractors = nearby polygons

🟩 CATEGORY 2 — Concept Understanding

Slightly higher-order classification.

Dynamic Example

Q: “Two lines that never meet are called ___ lines.”
Options:

Parallel (correct)

Intersecting

Perpendicular

Skew

Randomizable Template

Q: “Identify the relationship of the lines shown.”
You can randomize:

angle between lines

whether they intersect

whether they lie in the same plane

🟧 CATEGORY 3 — Procedural Skills

These involve computations like area, perimeter, angles, etc.

Example: Area of a Square

Template:

Find the area of a square with side length S.
Correct Answer = S × S
Distractors:
- S + S
- 2S
- S × 4

Examples generated:

Side = 3

Correct: 9

Distractors: 6, 12, 3

Side = 8

Correct: 64

Distractors: 16, 32, 8

Example: Area of Rectangle

Template:

Length = L, Width = W
Correct = LW
Distractors:
- L + W
- 2(L+W)
- |L−W|

Example: Finding Missing Angle (Linear Pair)
Angles form a linear pair.
Given angle A = X.
Find angle B.

Correct = 180 − X
Distractors:
- X
- 90
- 180 + X (trap)

Example: Circumference
C = 2πr
Distractors:
- πr²
- πr
- 4πr

🟥 CATEGORY 4 — Analytical Thinking

These are patterns, multi-step logic, or comparisons.

Sample Template
Two congruent triangles have one angle measuring A.
Find the measure of the corresponding angle in the other triangle.

Correct = A
Distractors: A ± (random small values)

Complex Template
A polygon has interior angles that increase by a constant pattern.
Find the missing angle.


Random values make each unique.

🟪 CATEGORY 5 — Problem-Solving

These are word problems requiring setup + solving.

Example Template
"A circular garden has radius r meters. 
How many meters of fencing are needed to go around it?"

Correct: 2πr
Distractors:
- πr²
- r²
- 4r

Example Template
"A rectangular lot is L by W meters. 
How many square meters is the entire lot?"

Correct = LW
Distractors = L+W, 2L+2W, LW/2

🟩 CATEGORY 6 — Higher Order Thinking / Creative Thinking

Multi-step reasoning using several geometry concepts.

Example Template
"A cone and a cylinder have the same radius and height.
Which has a larger volume?"

Options:
- Cylinder (correct)
- Cone
- Both equal
- Not enough information

HOTS Template
"A triangle's sides increase by 2 cm each. 
How does its perimeter change?"

Correct = increases by 6  
Distractors = +2, +4, doubled

🛠️ 3. System/Website Implementation Plan (Simple Version)
Every question stored in DB should include:
{
  id: number,
  category: string,
  question_text: string,
  optionA: string,
  optionB: string,
  optionC: string,
  optionD: string,
  correctOption: "A/B/C/D",
  randomValuesUsed: {...},
}

Algorithm for Dynamic Questions

Select template based on category

Randomize numbers (e.g., side = random(2–20))

Compute correct answer

Generate distractors (based on common student errors)

Shuffle answer order

Return MCQ to user

Your system will produce thousands of unique questions automatically.

Great! Below is exactly what you asked for:

✅ ✔ At least 5 dynamic questions per category
✅ ✔ With logic functions you can place inside your React (Next.js) project
✅ ✔ Works in page.tsx or any logic file
✔ Randomized numbers
✔ Automatically generates correct + incorrect options
✔ Returns ready-to-render MCQs
🟦 IMPORTANT STRUCTURE (highly recommended)

Create a folder:

/src/utils/questions/


Inside it, create:

generateQuestions.ts


In this file, define functions for each category.

🟩 OUTPUT FORMAT (all functions return this)

Each question will be returned as:

{
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  correct: string;
}


You can map these directly in your UI.

🟧 Here is the COMPLETE logic for ALL 6 categories

Paste this into generateQuestions.ts.
