# Audio Files for World Map Carousel

## Whoosh Sound Effect

The carousel uses a whoosh sound effect when transitioning between castles.

### How to add the sound file:

1. **Option 1: Download from the sample**
   - Download from: https://assets.codepen.io/605876/whoosh-two.mp3
   - Save as `whoosh.mp3` in this directory

2. **Option 2: Use your own sound**
   - Find any whoosh/swoosh/slide sound effect
   - Must be in MP3 format
   - Save as `whoosh.mp3` in this directory
   - Recommended duration: 0.3-0.6 seconds

3. **Option 3: Free sound resources**
   - Freesound.org
   - Zapsplat.com
   - Search for "whoosh" or "swish" sound effects

### Current Status:
- The placeholder `whoosh.mp3` file needs to be replaced with an actual audio file
- The carousel will work without sound, but won't play audio
- No errors will occur if the file is missing

### Testing:
- Once you add the audio file, refresh the page
- Click the arrow buttons to hear the whoosh sound
- Volume is set to 50% by default
